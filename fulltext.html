    <div class="poem">
        <h3>I</h3>
        In the silent countryside, amid the plains, <br>
        Far from the noisy dramas of life, <br>
        Lived a somber, gloomy man, <br>
        Andrey, forgotten by eternal sleep. <br>
        The old estate on the hill <br>
        Overlooked the dismal town below, <br>
        And there, among books and tables, <br>
        His soul slowly withered and waned. <br><br>
        He was young, but in that fire <br>
        That once was warmed by youthful passion, <br>
        He saw no bright years ahead, <br>
        His fate had long begun to dim. <br>
        Their youth—Marina and he— <br>
        Long forgotten in winter's gleam, <br>
        Yet in his heart, like a daily groan, <br>
        Her shadow echoed, bleak and unredeemed.
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <h3>II</h3>
        Love. Like in youth, it took hold, <br>
        Without resistance, like a secret delight. <br>
        The village, summer, and silence— <br>
        All turned into a gentle embrace. <br>
        Marina’s eyes, shining bright, <br>
        Gleamed like living stars above, <br>
        Their love, a spring, a storm’s delight, <br>
        In dreams of yearning, they would rove. <br><br>
        They met in gardens bright with oaks, <br>
        Where roses bloomed beneath the trees, <br>
        The quiet night their secret cloak, <br>
        Their hearts unbound by mysteries. <br>
        He whispered, "You are my light, <br>
        The sun of my forgotten days." <br>
        But then, it faded out of sight, <br>
        Like spring’s last snow dissolves in haze.
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <h3>III</h3>
        They parted in silence, as before, <br>
        When words are but the essence of farewell. <br>
        She left, forever closed the door <br>
        On promises love once tried to tell. <br>
        He couldn’t forget. One day she stepped <br>
        Into the vows of another life, <br>
        He saw the circle breaking, swept <br>
        Away from dreams and into strife. <br><br>
        Fate, like a thread, had broken then, <br>
        But pain would stay with him for years. <br>
        Their bond the same, yet silent, when <br>
        They met again, recalling tears.
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <h3>IV</h3>
        Andrey left his father’s land, <br>
        To wander fields and distant realms, <br>
        Seeking a place where he could stand, <br>
        Beyond the bounds of time’s constraints. <br>
        "The world is wide, yet I am small, <br>
        A grain of dust, devoid of hope." <br>
        His youth’s warmth he left withal, <br>
        To tread a darker, narrower scope.
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <h3>V</h3>
        He returned after years had passed, <br>
        His home now echoed sorrow’s tone. <br>
        Within, no trace of what had cast <br>
        A burning spell, when love had shone. <br>
        The garden he knew, its linden trees, <br>
        Once bloomed with blossoms soft and fair, <br>
        But love’s bright fire was now at ease, <br>
        A forgotten dream in autumn’s air.
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <h3>VI</h3>
        Marina lived within stone walls, <br>
        In shadows where joy could not dwell, <br>
        Bound by duty’s haunting calls, <br>
        She wore her silence as a shell. <br>
        Her family kept her life subdued, <br>
        She lived as a prisoner in their midst, <br>
        Her spirit broke, but still she viewed <br>
        Her life through dreams that once had kissed.
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <h3>VII</h3>
        And one day, fate brought them face to face, <br>
        In a crowded hall, their eyes met. <br>
        Andrey’s gaze a sudden blaze, <br>
        A fire of memories long set. <br>
        She stood, silent, bound in trance, <br>
        He too could find no words to say. <br>
        They passed each other without a glance, <br>
        Like shadows fading into gray.
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <h3>VIII</h3>
        Andrey then, upon his path, <br>
        Felt the passion deep inside rise. <br>
        Could he bring her from her wrath? <br>
        Was his heart but a fool's prize? <br>
        Yet the light in his soul still yearned, <br>
        For a spark that once was true. <br>
        Should he rekindle a fire burned, <br>
        Or let fate’s shadow be their due?
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <h3>IX</h3>
        Marina wrote a hidden note: <br>
        "Andrey, believe I forgot not you. <br>
        The years have gone, but each moment floats, <br>
        In memory’s river, strong and true." <br>
        She couldn’t stay, their paths too crossed, <br>
        Bound to another life and fate, <br>
        Yet still her spirit, tempest-tossed, <br>
        Longed for the fire love used to create.
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <h3>X</h3>
        They met one night in a shaded place, <br>
        Beneath the trees where linden bloomed. <br>
        Their hearts once more felt love’s embrace, <br>
        Their silent yearning filled the room. <br>
        "I cannot flee," Marina said, <br>
        "My duty binds me where I stand." <br>
        Andrey, bound by sorrow’s thread, <br>
        Felt his hope slip like grains of sand.
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <h3>XI</h3>
        He wandered far from love’s domain, <br>
        Through valleys wide and lands unknown. <br>
        Yet every step brought him to pain, <br>
        The memories of love’s sweet tone. <br>
        Marina’s face, her whispered name, <br>
        Followed him in darkened night. <br>
        Her gentle light, her burning flame, <br>
        Forever shone beyond his sight.
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <h3>XII</h3>
        The years slipped by in solemn stream, <br>
        Andrey's soul forever bound. <br>
        He lived a life where shadows gleamed, <br>
        And nature’s light was all around. <br>
        Yet in his heart, Marina stayed, <br>
        A shadow in his path unseen. <br>
        His love for her would never fade, <br>
        As long as life and dreams convene.
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <h3>XIII</h3>
        And so one day he learned her fate, <br>
        How life had taken her so far, <br>
        Their love was lost, but still innate, <br>
        An endless ache, a timeless scar. <br>
        Marina lived a life constrained, <br>
        By duty’s chains, a golden cell, <br>
        Her soul as fierce as love ingrained, <br>
        That distant star he loved too well.
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <h3>XIV</h3>
        Marina lay upon her bed, <br>
        In dim-lit halls where shadows creep, <br>
        Life’s final light around her shed, <br>
        And led her gently into sleep. <br>
        "Andrey," she whispered to the night, <br>
        "Forgive the pride that led me here. <br>
        My life was filled with hollow light, <br>
        In dreams that never were sincere."
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <h3>XV</h3>
        Andrey received her final note, <br>
        A message from her heart so deep. <br>
        "Live, love, my memory is a coat <br>
        To warm you when the shadows creep." <br>
        He set the letter on his desk, <br>
        The pain within his soul grew clear, <br>
        For life had taken her away, <br>
        But left his heart forever near.
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <h3>XVI</h3>
        He left forever, fading from sight, <br>
        In distant lands he found his peace, <br>
        Now nature’s honesty held him tight, <br>
        Its beauty a comforting release. <br>
        No longer bound by human needs, <br>
        His heart now free from earthly ties. <br>
        Only the forest, sky’s blue seeds, <br>
        Could soothe the pain within his eyes. <br><br>
        And there, like shadows of love’s past, <br>
        Marina’s face would haunt his way, <br>
        A gentle echo that would last, <br>
        As silent sorrow night and day. <br>
        He roamed beneath the forest’s shade, <br>
        Where memories grew like hidden trees, <br>
        A world of dreams that wouldn’t fade, <br>
        In solitude’s eternal peace.
